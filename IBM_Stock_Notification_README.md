# IBM Stock News and Notification System

This script fetches IBM stock prices and relevant news articles, calculates the percentage change in stock prices, and sends text notifications based on the changes. The notifications include significant price changes or lack thereof, as well as recent news updates. It uses the Alpha Vantage API for stock data, the News API for news articles, and Twilio for SMS notifications.

## Prerequisites

### Required Libraries
Install the following Python libraries:
- `requests`
- `pytz`
- `twilio`

Use pip to install them:
```bash
pip install requests pytz twilio
